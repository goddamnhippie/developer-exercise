# Simple Blackjack

## Usage

```bash
$ ruby play.rb [stand_value]
````

If you run `play.rb` without parameters, it enters interactive mode and you can chose whether to hit or stand after each card is dealt. If you pass a stand value a game simulation will take place and you will stand when all possible hand values are higher or equal to the stand value.
